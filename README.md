## For windows:
   We will use the flare vm or a standard windows machine in order to execute malware.

   ### Instructions:
      Build out a new virtual machine with a windows iso file, this will be used for the flare VM
      Complete the steps as prompt, ensure you do not perform updates (It will disable updates if you donâ€™t)
      
      After, you will need to disable windows defender.
      You can go into group policy and disable all of antivirus, as well as download a script to delete windows defender [here](https://github.com/ionuttbara/windows-defender-remover).

      Install the script for FlareVM [here](https://github.com/mandiant/flare-vm).
      Use the commands:
      1. (New-Object net.webclient).DownloadFile('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mandiant/flare-vm/main/install.ps1',"$([Environment]::GetFolderPath("Desktop"))\install.ps1")
      2. Unblock-File .\install.ps1
      3. Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force
         Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser -Force (if you have any issues)
